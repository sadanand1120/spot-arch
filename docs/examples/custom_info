------> To check battery, use 'batperc' (it's a system-wide alias). DO NOT trust acpi.
------> There is a shared Anaconda3 installation at /opt/anaconda3 -- thereby DO NOT install a local one. The 'base' environment is system-wide shared and can be activated as 'conda activate' as you normally do. You can create your own envs as you normally do and they will be saved LOCALLY in your user account.
------> Conda TAB completion is also setup system-wide!
------> ALL necessary CUDA, ROS, Anaconda3 etc paths have been configured, you do not need to add it yourself in your .bashrc.
